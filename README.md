# appwrap
Interfaces to abstract appengine datastore and memache for go, along with simple reimplementation for testing only. Enhancements
are welcome.

This is designed to work with the new appengine interfaces available as "google.golang.org/appengine" but it should be easy
to port to classic appengine.
